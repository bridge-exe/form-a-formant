# form-a-formant
 
Have you ever wanted to visualize your own personal idiolect? Amaze your friends by showing them your precise vocal range? No? Look no further. Using this simple minute-long test, you can create your own personal vowel chart! 

All that is needed is to record yourself saying each of the following words three times: 

#### 1. heed    =   '/hid/' 
#### 2. hid     =   '/hɪd/' 
#### 3. head    =   '/hɛd/'
#### 4. had     =   '/hæd/' 
#### 5. hot     =   '/hɑd/'
#### 6. hawed   =   '/hɔd/'
#### 7. hud     =   '/hʌd/'
#### 8. who'd   =   '/hud/'
#### 9. hood    =   '/hʊd/'
#### 10. how'd  =   '/haʊd/'
#### 11. hoyed  =   '/hoɪd/'
#### 12. hide   =   '/haɪd/'
#### 13. hoed   =   '/howd/'
#### 14. height =   '/hajt/'
#### 15. hayed  =   '/hejd/'
#### 16. herd   =   '/hɚd/' 
#### 17. ahead  =   '/əhɛd/'

As in: "heed, heed, heed, hid, hid, hid... ahead, ahead, ahead"

Then the program will automatically detect the average formant values for each of your monophthongs, and the trajectories of your diphthongs! 
Monophthongs: /i, ɪ, ɛ, æ, ɑ, ɔ, ʌ, u, ʊ, ɚ, ə/ 
Diphthongs: /aʊ, oɪ, aɪ, oʊ, aɪ-t, eɪ/ 

Finally, it will plot out your vowel sounds on a dynamic vowel chart, which will look something like this:

Pretty cool? 

Not perfect, but alright.
